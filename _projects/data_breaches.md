### Project Overview

The primary objective of our project is to create a bubble chart that visualizes organizations and the types of information compromised through hacking techniques such as email, SSN, credit card, personal details, and full details. Additionally, I aim to develop a bar chart that displays company names on the x-axis and the volume of data lost (in millions) on the y-axis. Lastly, I designed a donut chart to illustrate the number of organizations affected by each specific hacking technique.
