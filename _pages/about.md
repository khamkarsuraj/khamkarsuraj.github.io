Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer at [Atlantic Packaging](https://www.atlanticpkg.com/).

My work focuses on developing solutions for complex computations while delivering the best user interfaces for the company, utilizing technologies like React, Azure Cloud, and more.

As a technologist, I am passionate about all aspects of software engineering, data engineering, and cloud computing. I am eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with the community on open-source projects. I began my career at [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/), where I gained a solid foundation in software development and realized the vast depth of this field. Itâ€™s challenging but incredibly rewarding.
