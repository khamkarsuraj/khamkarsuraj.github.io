Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer at [Atlantic Packaging](https://www.atlanticpkg.com/).

My work focuses on developing solutions for complex computations while delivering the best user interfaces for the company, utilizing technologies like React, Azure Cloud, and more.

As a technologist, I am passionate about all aspects of software engineering, data engineering, and cloud computing. I am eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with the community on open-source projects. I began my career at [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/), where I gained a solid foundation in software development and realized the vast depth of this field. Itâ€™s challenging but incredibly rewarding.

I completed my MS in Computer Science from [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/index.html), where I deepened my expertise in various facets of software development, including artificial intelligence and mobile application development. During this time, I actively engaged in projects that provided hands-on, real-world experience, further enhancing my technical and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I contributed to open-source initiatives on GitHub, broadening my knowledge base and demonstrating my commitment to collaborative software development.

In my leisure time, I enjoy playing sports, particularly badminton and chess, exploring new destinations through travel, and hiking with friends to enjoy the outdoors.
